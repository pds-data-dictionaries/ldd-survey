## Notes

Each build is generating using the [lddtool](https://pds.nasa.gov/pds4/software/ldd/) specific to a version of the [PDS4 Information Model](https://pds.nasa.gov/pds4/doc/im/). The build command used is:

```
lddtool -lp ldd-file.xml
```

After a build the README.md files are updated (manually) to reflect the content of repository.
